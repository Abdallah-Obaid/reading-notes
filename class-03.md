# Three different types of lists:-
----------------------------------
* Ordered listsare lists where each item in the list is numbered.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists  are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms `<d1><dt><dd>`.
> We can also use nested lists:put list on a list.

# Boxes in Css:-
----------------------------------
* Css treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
* The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values: •hidden  •scroll
* Border, Margin & Padding described in this img:-

 # Switch statement and if-else statements:-
* When we use if-else statements, all the statements checked ecen if a match has been found `So it performs more slowly than switch`.
