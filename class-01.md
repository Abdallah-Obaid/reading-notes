* block level elements: Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. 
> Examples of block elements are; `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>`.
* inline elements: Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
> Examples of inline elements are: `<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>`.
* `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
* `<span>` element acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>` element. It is used to either:

2. Contain a number of inlineelements.
