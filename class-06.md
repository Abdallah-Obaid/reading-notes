# Problem Domain:-
----------------------------------
### Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming.
### Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain.
### It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  Itâ€™s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.
### You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

 # Objects-
 ----------------------------------
###  Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.  

### Programmers use a lot of name/value pairs: 
   * HTML uses attribute names and values.
   * CSS uses property names and values. 
#### In JavaScript: 
   * Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean. 
   * Arrays have a name and a group of values. (Each item in an array is a name/value pair because it has an index number and a value.) 
   * Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called. 
   * Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs (but the names are referred to as keys). 
### Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create opject.

 # The Document Object Model (DOM):-
 ----------------------------------
### The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
### DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes and text nodes.
### You can select element nodes by their id or clas attributes,by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
### Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a nodelist.
### In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent(and is apopular reason for using jQuery).
