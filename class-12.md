# Canvas:-
----------------------------------
* At first sight a `<canvas>` looks like the `<img>` element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes.
* The `<canvas>` element has only two attributes, width and height.
* The canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. 
* The `<canvas>` element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦).
* Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space.
* There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:
>fillRect(x, y, width, height)
 >Draws a filled rectangle.
>strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
 >Draws a rectangular outline.
>clearRect(x, y, width, height)
 >Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
* If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.
>fillStyle = color
 >Sets the style used when filling shapes.
>strokeStyle = color
 >Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
* The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:
>fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
 >Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
>strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
 >Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
