# Error handling and debugging:-
----------------------------------
* Debugging is the process of findinf errors. It involves a process of deduction.
* There 'is Developer Tools' to debug your work.
* If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code. 
* The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.

* Html have a new form that is easyer to be used
JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
* If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statement.Use them to give your users helpfu; feedback.
