# links:-
----------------------------------
* Links are created using the  X <a> element. 
* The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
> Ex for links :  `<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Abdallah-Obaid/About-Me">My-Githup</a></li> </ul>`

# Layout in Css:-
----------------------------------
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width).

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

 # Functions, Methods, and Objects:-
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
