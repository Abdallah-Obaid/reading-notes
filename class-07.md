# Problem Domain:-
----------------------------------
### Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming.
### Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain.
### It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  Itâ€™s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.
### You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

 # Tables:-
  ----------------------------------
###  The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row. 

### You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.)

### Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.)
  
### The <th> element is used just like the  <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)
### The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

 # Functions, Methods, and Objects:-
 ----------------------------------
### Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and document loaded into browser window.
### Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets(and both can contain the other).
### We can change the value of object properties after coling it.
