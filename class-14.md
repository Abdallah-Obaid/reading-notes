# Transitions and animation:-
----------------------------------
* One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.
* With CSS3 transitions We have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs.
*  The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:target` `pseudo-classes`.
* The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
* The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. 
* Scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
* The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
* Skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.
